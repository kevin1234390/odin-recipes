        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> I have french onion dip in my fridge, but no one is eating it</p>
        <p> It tastes kinda horrible, so I have had this recipe saved in hopes of redeeming this horrid dip</p>
        <p> will report back...</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>400g dried orecchiette pasta</li>
                <li>60g salted butter, melted</li>
                <li>1 tbsp chopped fresh continental parsley leaves</li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
                <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1 brown onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>400g Swiss brown mushrooms, thickly sliced</li>
                <li>250mL (1 cup) Massel Organic Beef Liquid Stock</li>
                <li>125mL (½ cup) light thickened cooking cream</li>
                <li>1 small baguette, cut into 8 slices</li>
                <li>200g tub French onion dip</li>
                <li>40g (½ cup) grated parmesan</li>
                <li>Fresh thyme sprigs, to serve (optional)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook the pasta in a large saucepan of salted boiling water for 2 minutes less than packet directions. Ladle 250mL (1 cup) pasta water into a jug and reserve. Drain the pasta.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, combine the butter, parsley and 1 garlic clove in a small bowl. Reserve. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion, mushroom and remaining garlic. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until tender.</li>
                <li>Add the stock, cream and pasta. Bring to the boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for 3 minutes or until sauce thickens and pasta is cooked, adding some reserved pasta water if too thick. Remove from heat. Toast bread and while warm, lightly brush 1 side of each slice with butter mixture. Stir dip and cheese through pasta. Season. Divide among serving bowls. Top with thyme, if using. Serve with garlic toast.</li>
