            <p> Same story as the french onion dip</p>
            <p> I love hummus dip, just that we bought this one really bad hummus dip, tasteless it was</p>
            <p> will report back with this one too</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>8 oz. Pasta of choice, gluten-free if necessary</li>
                <li>⅔–1 cup Garlic Hummus*</li>
                <li>¼ cup Sun-dried Tomatoes, sliced</li>
                <li>½ –¾ cup Filtered Water</li>
                <li>Juice of ½ Lemon</li>
                <li>Fresh Parsley or Basil, for serving</li>
                <li>Salt & Black Pepper, to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook your pasta according to package instructions.</li>
                <li>Use a colander to drain your pasta, but do not rinse. Return the pot to the stove over medium-low heat. Mix the hummus and 1/2 cup of filtered water together in the base of the pot, then slowly whisk additional water into the sauce until it reaches your desired consistency. Add in the sun-dried tomatoes and cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Return the pasta to the pot and fold it into the sauce. Turn off the heat and stir in the lemon juice, plus any salt & pepper if necessary. Transfer into serving bowls, top with fresh herbs, and enjoy!                    </li>
            </ol>
