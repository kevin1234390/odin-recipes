        <h2> Description</h2>
            <p>A one pot one shot recipe I stole from kannammacooks that I have not even tried yet.</p>
            <p> I've been meaning to try this since ages</p>
            <p> looks pretty easy, just pop onions and stuff in pressure cooker.</p>
        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>12 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
                <li>500 gram sliced onions ( 6 medium sized onions ).</li>
                <li>10–20 dry red chillies.</li>
                <li>2″ coin size.tamarind</li>
                <li>2 teaspoon of jaggery.</li>
                <li>2 teaspoon of home made / store bought sambar powder.</li>
                <li>2 teaspoon of salt.</li>                
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Take a pressure cooker (2 or 3 litres capacity only) and add 6 teaspoon of Indian sesame oil /gingely oil (nallennai).</li>
                <li>Add in 250 grams sliced onions ( 3 medium sized onions ).</li>
                <li>Add in 5-10 dry red chillies. (Add 5 chillies if you want a moderately spiced thokku / chutney. Increase the chillies if you want a spicy chutney.)</li>
                <li>Add a small piece of tamarind. About a 1″ coin size. Add in a teaspoon of jaggery. and a teaspoon of home made / store bought sambar powder. Add in a teaspoon of salt.</li>
                <li>Set your stove to medium high heat on a gas stove or your induction stove to 1200W. We are going to cook for exactly 5 minutes. Set up a timer in your mobile. Just 5 minutes irrespective of the number of whistles. You might end up getting 5-7 whistles.</li>
                <li>Wait for the pressure to release. Open the cooker. If there is a lot of liquid remaining in the cooker, just briefly simmer on high heat for a couple of minutes until the mixture is thick. Ignore this step if the mixture does not have liquid.</li>
                <li>Wait for the mixture to cool.</li>
                <li>Blend to a paste.</li>
                <li>Enjoy your thokku with rice, idli, dosa etc…</li>
            </ol>
